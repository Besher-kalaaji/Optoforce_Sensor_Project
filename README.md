# OctoForce Sensor Project

## Overview

This project involves the development of an OctoForce sensor designed to measure the force applied to the sensor using photodiodes. Two versions of the sensor were developed: the first using the Osram Opto BPW photodiode, and the second using the Texas Instruments OPT101P photodiode. These photodiodes detect changes in the distribution of light emitted by an IR light source. A custom-designed PCB was created specifically to meet the needs of this sensitive system.
